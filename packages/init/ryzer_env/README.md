 ### Initial Image Docker Setup

This is a special package that is always included with a ryzers build and not necessarily meant to be used directly.  
Its main purpose to set universal environment variables and/or add groups required by all ryzer Dockerfiles

## Build and Run the Docker Image

```bash
ryzer build --name init ryzer_env
ryzer run 
```
